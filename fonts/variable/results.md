<summary>🔥 <b>FAIL:</b> Ensure variable fonts include an avar table.</summary>

* [com.google.fonts/check/mandatory_avar_table](https://font-bakery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/fontbakery/profiles/googlefonts.html#com.google.fonts/check/mandatory_avar_table)
<pre>--- Rationale ---
Most variable fonts should include an avar table to correctly define axes
progression rates.
For example, a weight axis from 0% to 100% doesn&#x27;t map directly to 100 to 1000,
because a 10% progression from 0% may be too much to define the 200, while 90%
may be too little to define the 900.
If the progression rates of axes is linear, this check can be ignored. Fontmake
will also skip adding an avar table if the progression rates are linear.
However, we still recommend designers visually proof each instance is at the
desired weight, width etc.</pre>

* 🔥 **FAIL** This variable font does not have an avar table. [code: missing-avar]
